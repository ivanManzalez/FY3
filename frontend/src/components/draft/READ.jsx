The Problem:
Previously, the timer was not updating as expected, and there was no clear way to pause and resume it. The previous code didn't handle these functionalities well.

The New Solution:
The updated code introduces several key improvements:

UseInterval Custom Hook:

We define a custom hook called useInterval. This hook helps manage the interval timer for our countdown timer. It allows us to start, pause, and resume the timer easily.
State Variables:

We maintain state variables, such as currentTime and isRunning, to keep track of the timer's status.
Toggle Timer:

We implement a toggleTimer function. This function toggles the timer between "running" and "paused" states. It checks the isRunning state and acts accordingly.
Start and Pause Buttons:

We modify the "Start" button to change its label to "Pause" when the timer is running, and back to "Start" when paused. This provides clear visual feedback to the user and allows them to pause and resume the timer with a single button.
Timer Format Function:

We create a formatTime function to format the time in hours, minutes, and seconds. This makes the timer more human-readable.
Effect and Interval:

We use the useEffect hook to control the timer. When isRunning is true, we set up an interval timer using the useInterval hook to call updateTimer every second (1000 ms). This ensures that updateTimer is called repeatedly while the timer is running.
Update Timer:

The updateTimer function decrements the currentTime by 1 every second. When currentTime reaches 0, it automatically pauses the timer. This handles the countdown functionality.
Reset Timer:

We implement a "Restart" button that resets the timer to its initial value and pauses it.
Analogy:

Imagine the timer as a racing car and the isRunning state as a switch. When you click the "Start" button (the ignition key), the racing car starts to move (timer starts running). Clicking the "Pause" button (the brake pedal) stops the racing car (pauses the timer).

Before, our car didn't have clear controls for starting, pausing, and restarting. It was like trying to drive a car with a broken ignition and brake system.

Now, with the updated code, our car has a working ignition and brake system. You can easily start, pause, and restart it, and it displays the remaining time like a dashboard clock. The engine (interval) keeps the car moving (timer updating) when it's running, and it automatically stops (pauses) when the time runs out.

This code provides a smooth and intuitive experience for controlling the timer, making it easier for users to interact with and understand.
